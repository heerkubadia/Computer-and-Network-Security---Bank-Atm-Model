The ATM Protocol project involves implementing two programs: an atm client and a bank server. The atm allows customers to perform operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks. The bank server handles these operations securely, managing a single ATM at a time and maintaining data consistency. The primary goal is to build a secure, system that adheres to the specified communication protocol and error-handling requirements.
